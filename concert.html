	  <h4>Fanfare, Ode and Festival by Bob Margolis</h4>
		<p>Program notes from JW Pepper: Adapted from 16th century Renaissance wind music and carefully scored for the modern concert band, these three masterfully contrasted and very playable dances provide you with stunning results, fresh sounds, pleasant harmonic surprises and material that is rewarding to rehearse, to perform, and to hear!</p>

	  <h4>A Quiet Rain by Walter Cummings</h4>
		<p>Program Notes from JW Pepper: As the brass perform a melancholy tune, the subdued sounds of delicate woodwind and percussion parts create the gentle rain effects in this wonderful tone poem for younger bands. This is really quite playable by young musicians, yet the sophistication of the musical ideas will help your students experience the power of music to evoke images. </p>

        <h4>Ancient Voices by Michael Sweeney</h4>
		<p>Program Notes from the Canaseraga Band Program: This composition is suggestive of the moods and sounds of early civilizations. 
The music has not been written in an attempt to depict any specific culture or 
continent. The sounds you hear however, may bring to mind early 
populations that may have used the bones of Mammoths and other animals 
as musical instruments. Michael Sweeney has incorporated a number of 
unique performance techniques during this piece such as using a classroom 
recorder, tone clusters, pencil tapping, and even singing.</p>

	  <h4>Kentucky 1800, Clare Grundman</h4>
		<p>Kentucky 1800 is based on the tunes of three American folk songs: The Promised Land, Cindy, and I'm Sad and I'm Lonely, melodies which are reminiscent of the years the pioneers were forging westward. It is a rhapsodic tone poem in which thematic material is treated in great depth and with variety. The work is a band masterpiece which has long since become a favorite with audiences.</p>

He taught instrumental music in the schools of Maryland and New Jersey for 33 years.

This beautiful work is rich in melodic content, varied scoring, and marvelous counterlines and harmonies.</p>

        <h4>March of the Irish Guard, James Ployhar</h4>
		<p>Program Notes from JW Pepper: A spirited march treatment of the tune known as The Boys Of Wexford, this lively arrangement really moves along! After a contrasting middle section in 6/8 featuring bagpipe effects, the opening returns to finish off the piece with a grand, fully scored climax. </p>
